# HTML 5 Toys
Just a collection of small animations and toys I've been playing around with to 
refresh myself with javascript and some graphics concepts.

## Particles and Frames

A refresher on how frames work. Particles that appear inside the left frame are 
replicated in the right frame. The right frame's origin, I, and J vectors can 
be moved around to better demonstrate how they work. For fun, they're turned 
into portals at the bottom.

## Spirographs 

Technically hypotrochoids. Started drawing one to learn how they worked. They're 
so cool that I ended up trying to make a cool animation out of them. Turns out 
three spirographs, lots of linear interpolations, random numbers and pretty colors 
make a really mesmerizing animation!
